# Intelligent Skin Cancer Screening (ISCS)
The goal of this project is to employ an intelligent system for the identification of abnormalities by analyzing images of the skin tissues. The focus will be on leveraging advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze images and train the model to identify if the image of the skin is showing malignant or benignant cancer.
